The aim of this project was to implement a Classification and Regression Tree Algorithm from scratch
Building the Decision tree involves :-
    Gini Index -> Cost Function which is used to evaluate splits on the dataset
    Create Split-> Splitting a dataset involves iterating over each row, checking if the attribute value is below or above the split value and assigning it to the left and         right group respectively
    Evaluate the split-> With the help of Ginni Function find the best possible split we could make, It will be used as a node in our decision Tree
    The final step involves building the tree
The model is trained and tested on Banknote datset.
The Banknote dataset involves whether a given banknote is authentic or not, given a number of measures from the photograph
The accuracy of the model is 97%.
